## Hey There 👋, I'm Tayfun AYDINÖZ! <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/tayfunaydinoz/'><img align='center' alt="linkedin" src="https://github.com/tayfunaydinoz/GithubProfile/blob/eb12ddcf9d8000b7c5a1b873498d79b4cb61d5e8/LinkedInLogoPNG.png" height='30px'/></a>

I'm a mechatronics engineer who worked as a mechanical design engineer and who was always into software development. After my last project, which was about the designing and software configuration of Industrial 3D printer. I have decided that it was time to focus on software development.
